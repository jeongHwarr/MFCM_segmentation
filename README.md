### Tissue Segmentation Using Modified Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm on Mammography (Image segmentation)

This code uses modified fuzzy c-means algorithm (MFCM) to do tissue segmentation on mammography. This code is a implementation of The paper:

[1] Z. Chen and R. Zwiggelaar, 2010. 'A Modified Fuzzy C Means Algorithm for Breast Tissue Density Segmentation in Mammogramsâ€™, IEEE/Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine (ITAB) (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5687751)

## How to run?

### Run on mini data as default option 
You just run <u>main.py<\u> in editor or enter <u>python main.py<\u> in command prompt.
(In <i>img<\i> directory, there are 2 images for the test. These images are part of mini-MIAS database. (http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html) ) 

### User mode
If you want to replace the mini data with your own data, put your images to img directory or edit path for your direrectory in <u>main.py<\u>.   
If you change parameters of your experiment, you can change parameters by changing the default value of the argument in <u>main.py<\u> or you can you the command line in command prompt.
- You can see all the adjustable parameters and usage. </pre> python main.py --help</pre>
(For example, if you want to cluster with 5 clusters, enter this command in your command prompt.  </u>python main.py -c 5<\u>)

|mdb321.jpg|<img src = 'result.png'>|
|mdb322.jpg|<img src = 'result2.png'>|  


## Troubleshooting:
1. If it is not an 8-bit image, the code needs to be modified.
2. When there is a problem with the environment, you can try this command line in your command prompt. <pre> pip install -r requirements.txt </pre>

## TODO:
- [ ] It takes a lot of time to get the filtered image. This problem can be solved by using numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided.
